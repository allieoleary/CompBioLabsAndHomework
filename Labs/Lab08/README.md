# Lab 08 Information

## Purpose of this Script
This script contains a function that allows the user to insert different variables to solve for population abundance using the [_Discrete-Time Logistic Growth Equation_](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/LogisticEquation.html).  

The variables that are subject to change within the population include:
> **r** = intrinsic growth rate 
 
> **K** = the carrying capacity 
 
> **time** = the total number of generations under study  

> **abundance** = the beginning abundance 

## Data Specific to "GenTime" File
The variables that were used in the file were:
> **r** = 0.8 
 
> **K** = 10,000
 
> **time** = 12

> **abundance** = 2,500

When this was plugged into the LogisticGrowthFunction, we could then export that information into the [GenTime.csv](https://github.com/allieoleary/CompBioLabsAndHomework/blob/master/Labs/Lab08/GenTime.csv) which is also present in the repository.
